The operations of buildings account for 30\% of global final energy consumption and 26 \% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions \cite{IEA.06.01.2024}. This makes the optimization of energy consumption a major concern for environmental sustainability. This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to streamline energy usage within a single-family home, leveraging solar panels, electric batteries, heat pumps, and flexible demand mechanisms. The primary aim is to reduce the carbon footprint associated with housing operations.
