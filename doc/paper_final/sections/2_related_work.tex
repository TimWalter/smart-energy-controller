The application field of smart energy management encompasses a wide range of problems, such as heating and cooling \cite{Blum.2021}\cite{ThomasSchreiber.2020}, flexible demand response \cite{Jin.2021} and energy storage \cite{Nakabi.2021}. Moreover, the scale and level of detail of the tackled problems vary greatly, going from single buildings \cite{Blum.2021}, to microgrids \cite{Nakabi.2021} \cite{Castellanos.04.12.2022}, to eventually continent-wide electricity grids \cite{Horsch.2018}. The two most promising approaches to solve such problems are classical Model Predictive Control (MPC) \cite{Basantes.2023} and Reinforcement Learning (RL) \cite{Nakabi.2021} \cite{Jin.2021} \cite{ThomasSchreiber.2020}\cite{Zhu.2022}. Furthermore, there are also hybrid approaches that combine the two methods \cite{JavierArroyo.2022}.

This paper is mainly inspired by \cite{Nakabi.2021}, who describe a microgrid environment with generation, storage, and consumers, where they optimize electricity pricing using various DRL algorithms. The inspiration is limited to the modelling of residential housing by the three major components Energy Storage System (ESS), Thermostatically Controlled Load (TCL), and Flexible Demand Response (FDR). Differentiation is given in the objective, which is to minimize the CO\textsubscript{2} equivalent emissions, and the setting, where the environment is a single household optimised from the perspective of the inhabitants instead of the electricity provider. Moreover, the dynamics of the ESS and in particular the FDR are original.
