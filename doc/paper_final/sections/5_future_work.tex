This paper provides an open challenge with a novel formulation of the problem of carbon intensity minimization in a smart home environment. To further enhance control, future work can explore model-based learning techniques, which could utilize the rich and aligned reward calculation. Moreover, imitation learning from rule-based controllers should guide the optimization and improve sample efficiency. Another promising approach to the problem is trying to predict the carbon intensity accurately for the desired period and then optimizing the control sequence for that period classically.
