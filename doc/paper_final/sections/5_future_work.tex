This paper provides an open challenge with a novel formulation of the problem of carbon intensity minimization in a smart home environment. The effective application of deep reinforcement learning could only be demonstrated limitedly and state of the art control theoretic approaches are likely to outperform them significantly. This leaves room for further research, which could explore model-based learning techniques, that utilize the rich and aligned reward calculation. Moreover, imitation learning from rule-based controllers should guide the optimization and improve sample efficiency. Another promising approach would be predicting the carbon intensity for the desired period and then optimizing the control sequence classically.
