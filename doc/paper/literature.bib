@misc{Castellanos.04.12.2022,
 abstract = {As multi-microgrids become readily available, some limited models have been proposed that study operational and power quality constraints with local energy markets independently. This paper proposes a convex optimization model of an energy management system with operational and power quality constraints and interactions in a Local Energy Market (LEM) for unbalanced microgrids (MGs). The LEM consists of a pre-dispatch step and an energy transactions step (ETS). The ETS combines the MGs' objectives while considering two strategies: minimize the cost of buyers or maximize the revenue of sellers. Our proposed model considers harmonic distortion and voltage limit power quality constraints in both steps. Moreover, we model operational constraints such as power flow, power balance, and distributed energy resources behaviors and capacities. We numerically evaluate the proposed model using three unbalanced MGs with residential, industrial, and commercial load profiles, where each microgrid manages its resources locally. Furthermore, we create two groups of cases to analyze the interactions in the local energy market. In the first group, the price of the DSO energy and the surplus from MGs to DSO are the same. The numerical results show that using the increasing revenue strategy promotes MGs to interact more while encouraging them to have high energy prices. When the reducing cost strategy is used, fewer energy interactions occur, and the price of MGs energy is encouraged to be lower.},

@article{Horsch.2018,
 abstract = {PyPSA-Eur, the first open model dataset of the European power system at the transmission network level to cover the full ENTSO-E area, is presented. It contains 6001 lines (alternating current lines at and above 220 kV voltage level and all high voltage direct current lines), 3657 substations, a new open database of conventional power plants, time series for electrical demand and variable renewable generator availability, and geographic potentials for the expansion of wind and solar power. The model is suitable both for operational studies and generation and transmission expansion planning studies. The continental scope and highly resolved spatial scale enables a proper description of the long-range smoothing effects for renewable power generation and their varying resource availability. The restriction to freely available and open data encourages the open exchange of model data developments and eases the comparison of model results. A further novelty of the dataset is the publication of the full, automated software pipeline to assemble the load-flow-ready model from the original datasets, which enables easy replacement and improvement of the individual parts. This paper focuses on the description of the network topology, the compilation of a European power plant database and a top-down load time-series regionalisation. It summarises the derivation of renewable wind and solar availability time-series from re-analysis weather datasets and the estimation of renewable capacity potentials restricted by land-use. Finally, validations of the dataset are presented, including a new methodology to compare geo-referenced network datasets to one another.},

@article{JavierArroyo.2022,
 abstract = {Buildings need advanced control for the efficient and climate-neutral use of their energy systems. Model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) arise as two powerful control techniques that have been extensively investigated in the literature for their application to building energy management. These methods show complementary qualities in terms of constraint satisfaction, computational demand, adaptability, and intelligibility, but usually a choice is made between both approaches. This paper compares both control approaches and proposes a novel algorithm called reinforced predictive control (RL-MPC) that merges their relative merits. First, the complementarity between RL and MPC is emphasized on a conceptual level by commenting on the main aspects of each method. Second, the RL-MPC algorithm is described that effectively combines features from each approach, namely state estimation, dynamic optimization, and learning. Finally, MPC, RL, and RL-MPC are implemented and evaluated in BOPTEST, a standardized simulation framework for the assessment of advanced control algorithms in buildings. The results indicate that pure RL cannot provide constraint satisfaction when using a control formulation equivalent to MPC and the same controller model for learning. The new RL-MPC algorithm can meet constraints and provide similar performance to MPC while enabling continuous learning and the possibility to deal with uncertain environments.},

@article{ThomasSchreiber.2020,
 abstract = {With the increasing use of volatile renewable energies, the requirements for building automation and control systems (BACS) are increasing. Load shifting within local energy systems stabilizes fluctuations in the grid and can be triggered by price signals. The energy purchase can thus be considered and solved as an optimal control problem. Classical approaches, often based on the optimization of mathematical models, are uneconomical in many cases, due to the high effort involved in the model creation. Algorithms from the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), on the other hand, have a high potential for the automation of energy system optimization, due to their model-free and data-driven characteristics. However, there is still a lack of studies that examine algorithms for BACS-related applications in a structured way. Therefore, we present a study, investigating the potential of two different RL algorithms for load shifting in a cooling supply system. We combine the benefits of Modelica, a powerful modeling language, with RL algorithms and demonstrate how generalized relationships and control decisions can be learned. The case study is modeled according to a cooling supply system in Berlin, Germany. The two different algorithms (DQN and DDPG) are used to control the operation parameters of a central compression chiller, with respect to a price signal. While real monitoring data are used as exogenous influences, the thermal dynamics of the cooling network are simulated. With the learned policies, flexibility in the network is used which leads on average to weekly cost savings of 14 {\%}, compared to direct load coverage. Our results suggest that, under certain conditions, RL is a suitable alternative to established methods. However, we also acknowledge that there are still research questions to address before RL can be applied in real BACS.},

@article{Zhu.2022,
 abstract = {Owing to large industrial energy consumption, industrial production has brought a huge burden to the grid in terms of renewable energy access and power supply. Due to the coupling of multiple energy sources and the uncertainty of renewable energy and demand, centralized methods require large calculation and coordination overhead. Thus, this paper proposes a multi-energy management framework achieved by decentralized execution and centralized training for an industrial park. The energy management problem is formulated as a partially-observable Markov decision process, which is intractable by dynamic programming due to the lack of the prior knowledge of the underlying stochastic process. The objective is to minimize long-term energy costs while ensuring the demand of users. To solve this issue and improve the calculation speed, a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, which contains the following key points: counterfactual baseline for facilitating contributing agents to learn better policies, soft actor-critic for improving robustness and exploring optimal solutions. A novel reward is designed by Lagrange multiplier method to ensure the capacity constraints of energy storage. In addition, considering that the increase in the number of agents leads to performance degradation due to large observation spaces, an attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the stability of policy and enable agents to focus on important energy-related information, which improves the exploration efficiency of soft actor-critic. Numerical results based on actual data verify the performance of the proposed algorithm with high scalability, indicating that the industrial park can minimize energy costs under different demands.},
