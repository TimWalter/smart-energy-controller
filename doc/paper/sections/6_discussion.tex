This paper provides an open challenge with a novel formulation of the problem of carbon intensity minimization in a smart home environment. Various experiments were run to test hypothesis on the cause of the learning inefficiency. While no single hypothesis led to a complete solution, two out of three aided the learning of some sub-tasks. A promising future direction would be to combine the various policies into an ensemble, with each controlling one subsystem.
