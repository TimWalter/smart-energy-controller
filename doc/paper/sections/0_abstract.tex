Buildings account for a significant portion of global energy consumption and emissions. This paper explores how smart energy management systems in single-family homes can potentially reduce emissions, focusing on homes equipped with photovoltaic systems, electric batteries, and system-controllable appliances. The aim is to optimize energy consumption and generation capacities to minimize emissions, manage load flexibility, and alleviate grid pressure from fluctuating renewable energy sources. The controller also enables the sale of cleanly generated electricity to the grid at a discounted emission premium. The control mechanisms involve deep reinforcement learning algorithms benchmarked against traditional thresholding models and the theoretical optimum.
