This section will describe the algorithms used to solve the MDP. The algorithms will be benchmarked against a theoretical optimum and a thresholding model, which is also described here.
\subsection{Thresholding Model}
A quick subsection about the non machine learning baseline
\subsection{Theoretical Optimum}
A quick subsection about the theoretical optimum
\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}
Subsection that presents the reinforcement learning algorithms used to solve the MDP
