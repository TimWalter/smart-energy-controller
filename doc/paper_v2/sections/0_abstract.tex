This paper provides a novel formulation of the problem of carbon intensity minimization in a smart home environment. The environment includes an energy storage system, a heat pump, and a flexible demand. The environment is formulated as a Markov Decision Process and tested using state of the art reinforcement learning methods. The effectivness of the algorithms is compared to rule-based controllers. To improve performance three hypotheses and accompanying modifications were explored in an effort to aid the learning process.
